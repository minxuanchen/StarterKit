Analysis Summary Report

A histogram is an accurate graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable).
A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a line graph. A bar graph shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one, showing the values of more than one measured variable.
In R, the two kinds of plot sometimes may have the same data value. But they are not the same. But both of them can be used to show data distribution.
Histogram was used to show the distribution of Revenue while bar plot was used to show Unitsold.
We can see that under all the subset we used from the dataset, the the distribution of Revenue is not normal while the distribution of Unitsold is normal.
If we need to set up a model, we might need to modify the distribution for that many models require normal distribution dataset.
